# berkeley-ai-reinforcement

Implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms as part of the Berkeryl AI project. Developed for an Artificial Intelligence course at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Artifical Intelligence major.

## Project Overview

This repository focuses on classic reinforcement learning algorithms and environments, including:
- Q-Learning
- SARSA
- Policy iteration/value iteration (optioneel)
- Example AI agents that learn by interacting with their environment

The project demonstrates how agents learn optimal actions by maximizing future rewards, with code, experiments and visualizations.

## Collaboration & Credits

This project was a **collaborative effort** by Ebubekir Kahriman and Mohamed Amine Zarouali.  
Originally developed together for a course at VUB, further updated here for portfolio and academic purposes.
